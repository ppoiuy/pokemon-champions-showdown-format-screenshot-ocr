## Gemini API Key

A Gemini API key is required.

Get a free API key from Google AI Studio:
https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

The app persists your key locally when **Save key** is enabled.

## Toggles

- **Auto-format Mega** (default: off) — rewrites species to Mega form and swaps ability when a Mega Stone item is detected
- **Fuzzy match** (default: on) — corrects close OCR misspellings against the Showdown dataset using Levenshtein distance
- **AI form lookup** (default: off, unreliable) — asks Gemini to identify the Pokemon sprite and return the correct form name
- **Custom form match** (default: on) — applies rule-based form corrections for specific Pokemon

## Warnings

- OCR can make mistakes. Always review the extracted data before using it.
- AI form lookup is unreliable — Gemini often misidentifies sprites or returns the wrong form suffix.
- The tool uses Pokemon Showdown data for validation. Pokemon Champions may have a different legal move/item pool.
- Stat points are capped at 32 per stat and 66 total based on Pokemon Champions rules.

The following forms cannot be automatically detected by Custom form match because they require visual sprite, type, or stat inspection. They must be set manually in the Team Editor:

Basculegion-F, Maushold-Four, Gourgeist-Large, Gourgeist-Small, Gourgeist-Super, Polteageist-Antique, Sinistcha-Masterpiece, Tauros-Paldea-Combat, Vivillon-Fancy, Vivillon-Pokeball

## Privacy

- Your API key is stored in your browser's local storage when saved.
- Screenshots are sent to Google's Gemini API for OCR processing.
- No data is stored on any server.

## Validation

The app shows warnings for invalid species, items, abilities, moves, natures, or stat point totals. Validation uses Pokemon Showdown data as a baseline.
